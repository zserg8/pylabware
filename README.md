## Features
- Wide range of supported hardware
- Supports both serial/RS-232 and Ethernet connection to the devices.
- Provides thread-safe parallel execution of several commands per device.
- Provides single interface per device type irrespective of a particular manufacturer.
- Simulation mode to test your code before executing it with real hardware.
- Easy addition of new devices.
